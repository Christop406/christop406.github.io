# Portfolio Site (Angular Version)

This is the Angular version (default) of my portfolio site.

## Highlights

- Supports SSR via `@angular/universal` and has a target to run prerendering (though I don't use it for this simple site).
- Built using Webpack and the Angular CLI
- Uses Modern (2+) versions of Angular
