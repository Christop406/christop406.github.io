# Portfolio Site (Main)

This repository holds the code for my (Chris Gilardi) portfolio site. There are 2 versions of the site: one written using Angular and TypeScript (this one), and one written using React/TypeScript.

The intention of this site/repository is to showcase my abilities and to keep the two implementations of the site in close parity.

## React

The React version of the portfolio site can be [found here](/react).

## Highlights

- Supports SSR via `@angular/universal` and has a target to run prerendering (though I don't use it for this simple site).
- Built using Webpack and the Angular CLI
- Uses Modern (2+) versions of Angular
