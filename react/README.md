# Portfolio Site (React Version)

This portion of the project is meant to act as a showcase for my React skillset. It is intended to be a 1:1 recreation of the Angular
version of the site that should use React best practices and modern development procedures to create a usable site with clean, reusable
components and features.

## Highlights

- This portion of the project was created without using any "initialize" commands, including for Tailwind and Vite (manually created configs).
- Build toolchain powered by Vite (as opposed to Webpack), a newer project offering easier setup and a more modern build process.
- Uses the latest React version (as of 2023-05-19).
